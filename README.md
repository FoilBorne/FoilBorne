- 👋 Hi, I’m @FoilBorne
- 👀 I’m interested in engineering topics, fluid dynamics, and I work with hydrofoils and designing surfboards.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use OpenFOAM on a Windows 11 WSL2 through Ubuntu, as well as XFOIL/XFLR5.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fluid dynamic discussions, hydrofoil & efoil designs and Python and MATLAB scripts.
- 📫 How to reach me? I'm new to GitHub, is there a PM type of system here?
